# FHIRPath Test Compliance

This page shows the current compliance status with the official FHIRPath test suite, indicating which features are currently supported by the Aether FHIRPath implementation.

## Test Results Summary

Based on the latest test run of the official FHIRPath test suite:

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| ✅ **Passed** | 179 | 25.2% |
| ❌ **Failed** | 501 | 70.5% |
| ⏭️ **Skipped** | 31 | 4.4% |
| **Total** | **711** | **100%** |

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Currently Supported Features

The following FHIRPath features are currently working and pass the official tests:

- **Basic Path Navigation**: Simple property access and navigation
- **Collection Operations**: Basic collection handling and iteration
- **String Operations**: String manipulation and comparison functions
- **Numeric Operations**: Basic arithmetic and numeric comparisons
- **Boolean Logic**: Basic boolean operations and comparisons
- **Type Checking**: Basic type validation and conversion
- **Telecom Access**: Patient telecom data access and filtering

### ❌ Known Limitations

The following features are not yet implemented or have known issues:

- **Advanced Functions**: Many built-in functions like `conformsTo()` are not implemented
- **Complex Operators**: Some advanced operators and syntax patterns
- **Date/Time Operations**: Advanced date and time manipulation
- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching and regex operations
- **Advanced Type Conversions**: Complex type casting and conversion
- **Aggregate Functions**: Advanced collection aggregation operations

### ⏭️ Skipped Tests

Some tests are currently skipped due to:
- Missing input data files
- XML to JSON conversion requirements
- Test environment setup issues

## Test Groups Status

The official FHIRPath test suite is organized into several test groups. Here's the status of major test groups:

### Core Functionality
- **testBasics**: Partially supported - basic path navigation works
- **testMiscellaneousAccessorTests**: Mixed results - some accessor patterns work
- **testConformsTo**: Not supported - `conformsTo()` function not implemented

### Data Types
- **String Operations**: Partially supported
- **Numeric Operations**: Partially supported  
- **Boolean Operations**: Partially supported
- **Date/Time Operations**: Limited support

### Advanced Features
- **Function Library**: Many functions not yet implemented
- **Complex Expressions**: Limited support for complex syntax
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling implemented

## How to Interpret Results

- **✅ Passed**: The feature works correctly and matches expected FHIRPath behavior
- **❌ Failed**: The feature is not implemented or has bugs that cause incorrect results
- **⏭️ Skipped**: The test couldn't run due to missing dependencies or setup issues

## Continuous Improvement

This implementation is actively being developed. The test compliance will improve over time as more features are implemented. Key areas of focus include:

1. **Function Library Expansion**: Implementing missing built-in functions
2. **Operator Support**: Adding support for advanced operators
3. **Error Handling**: Improving error messages and edge case handling
4. **Performance**: Optimizing evaluation performance for complex expressions

## Running Tests Locally

To run the official FHIRPath tests locally:

```bash
cd fhirpath-core
cargo test run_official_fhirpath_tests -- --nocapture
```

This will show detailed results for each test, including which expressions are being evaluated and their results.
