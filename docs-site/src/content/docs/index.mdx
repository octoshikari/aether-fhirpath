## Overview

Aether FHIRPath is a comprehensive implementation of the [FHIRPath specification](http://hl7.org/fhirpath/) written in Rust. FHIRPath is a path-based navigation and extraction language for FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data.

## Features

</CardGrid>

## Components

This project provides three main components:

- **fhirpath-core**: The core FHIRPath engine with lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation
- **fhirpath-cli**: A command-line interface for FHIRPath evaluation and validation
- **fhirpath-node**: Node.js bindings for JavaScript/TypeScript integration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
cargo install --path fhirpath-cli

# Evaluate a FHIRPath expression
aether-fhirpath eval "Patient.name.given" patient.json
```
