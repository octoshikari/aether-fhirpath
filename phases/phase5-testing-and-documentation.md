# Phase 5: Testing and Documentation - Status

## Overview
This phase focuses on comprehensive testing, documentation, and creating example applications for the FHIRPath engine.

## Tasks

### 1. Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all components with `cargo nextest` for parallel execution
- [ ] Integration tests with real FHIR resources
- [ ] Conformance tests against FHIRPath specification examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks with Criterion and published dashboards
- [ ] Run the same test matrix in Node.js to validate bindings

**Status**: Not started

### 2. Documentation
- [ ] Generate a `docs/` microsite (Docusaurus/VitePress) from one source of markdown

- [ ] Usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Contributing guidelines
- [ ] Security considerations and audit checklist

**Status**: Not started

### 3. Create example applications
- [ ] CLI tool (`fhirpath-cli`) for manual testing and demos
