# Phase 1: Project Setup - Status

## Overview
This phase focuses on setting up the initial project structure, testing framework, and Node.js binding infrastructure.

## Tasks

### 1. Create project structure
- [x] Initialize a Cargo workspace with multiple crates (`fhirpath-core`, `fhirpath-cli`, `fhirpath-node`)
- [x] Set up directory structure for lexer, parser, evaluator, and Node.js bindings
- [x] Configure Cargo.toml with pinned dependencies
- [x] Add a `devcontainer.json` or `Dockerfile` for consistent development environment
- [x] Add repository hygiene tools (Clippy, rustfmt) to CI checks

**Status**: Completed

### 2. Set up testing framework
- [x] Configure test suite using Rust's built-in testing framework and `cargo nextest` for parallel testing
- [x] Download and commit the official FHIRPath test cases from the specification
- [x] Create a build script that can update test fixtures when needed
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) with matrix testing

**Status**: Completed

### 3. Set up Node.js binding infrastructure
- [x] Add napi-rs for Node.js bindings with support for both CommonJS and ES Modules
- [x] Configure build process for multiple platforms using `cargo zigbuild` or `cross + zig`
- [x] Set up TypeScript type definitions generation

**Status**: Completed

## Overall Phase Status
- **Completion**: 100%
- **Started Date**: 2025-07-17
- **Completed Date**: 2025-07-17
- **Notes**: Phase 1 has been fully implemented with all tasks completed.

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2: Core FHIRPath Engine Implementation
- Implement lexer for FHIRPath expressions
- Implement parser for FHIRPath grammar
- Implement data model for FHIRPath
