# Phase 3: Advanced Features - Status

## Overview
This phase focuses on implementing advanced features of the FHIRPath engine, including navigation, filtering, projection, and polymorphic behavior.

## Tasks

### 1. Implement navigation features
- [x] Path navigation and traversal
- [x] Context management for evaluation
- [x] Handling of complex paths and recursion
- [ ] Add "streaming mode" for very large resources using `serde_json::Deserializer::from_reader`

**Status**: Mostly complete (3/4 tasks done)

### 2. Implement filtering and projection
- [x] Where, select, and other collection operations
- [x] Implement collection manipulation functions
- [ ] Optimize for memory efficiency on large collections

**Status**: Mostly complete (2/3 tasks done)

### 3. Implement polymorphic behavior
- [x] Type-based function dispatch
- [x] Handling of null/empty values
- [x] Implement FHIRPath equality semantics
- [ ] Handle time-zone and precision rules for date/time types (`@2012-04` vs `@2012-04-01T00:00:00Z`)

**Status**: Mostly complete (3/4 tasks done)

### 4. Optimization
- [ ] Implement expression optimization
- [ ] Add caching strategies
- [ ] Benchmark and profile for performance improvements
- [ ] Compare performance with existing FHIRPath implementations (HAPI Java, HL7 JavaScript, Google's fhir-py)

**Status**: Not started

## Overall Phase Status
- **Completion**: 53% (8/15 tasks completed)
- **Started Date**: In progress
- **Completed Date**: Not completed
- **Notes**: Significant progress made on Phase 3. Navigation, filtering, and polymorphic behavior are mostly implemented. Optimization features remain to be implemented.

## Next Steps
- Fix logical operations bug (test_evaluate_logical failing)
- Implement streaming mode for large resources
- Add memory optimization for large collections
- Implement date/time precision and timezone handling
- Begin optimization features (expression optimization, caching, benchmarking)
