# Phase 3: Advanced Features - Status

## Overview
This phase focuses on implementing advanced features of the FHIRPath engine, including navigation, filtering, projection, and polymorphic behavior.

## Tasks

### 1. Implement navigation features
- [x] Path navigation and traversal
- [x] Context management for evaluation
- [x] Handling of complex paths and recursion
- [x] Add "streaming mode" for very large resources using `serde_json::Deserializer::from_reader`

**Status**: Complete (4/4 tasks done)

### 2. Implement filtering and projection
- [x] Where, select, and other collection operations
- [x] Implement collection manipulation functions
- [x] Optimize for memory efficiency on large collections

**Status**: Complete (3/3 tasks done)

### 3. Implement polymorphic behavior
- [x] Type-based function dispatch
- [x] Handling of null/empty values
- [x] Implement FHIRPath equality semantics
- [x] Handle time-zone and precision rules for date/time types (`@2012-04` vs `@2012-04-01T00:00:00Z`)

**Status**: Complete (4/4 tasks done)

### 4. Optimization
- [x] Implement expression optimization
- [x] Add caching strategies
- [x] Benchmark and profile for performance improvements
- [x] Compare performance with existing FHIRPath implementations (HAPI Java, HL7 JavaScript, Google's fhir-py)

**Status**: Complete (4/4 tasks done)
