# Phase 2: Core FHIRPath Engine Implementation - Status

## Overview
This phase focuses on implementing the core components of the FHIRPath engine, including the lexer, parser, data model, and expression evaluator.

## Tasks

### 1. Lexer implementation
- [x] Implement tokenization of FHIRPath expressions
- [x] Handle identifiers, literals, operators, and functions
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for lexer functionality
- [x] Create diagnostic error types with source span information for better error messages

**Status**: Completed

### 2. Parser implementation
- [x] Create abstract syntax tree (AST) representation
- [x] Decide between `nom` (streaming) or `pest` (PEG) parser approach and document the choice
- [x] Implement recursive descent parser for FHIRPath grammar
- [x] Handle operator precedence and associativity
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for parser functionality
- [x] Place the official FHIRPath grammar file (`.g4`/`.ebnf`) in `docs/spec/` for reference

**Status**: Completed

### 3. Data model implementation
- [x] Evaluate existing FHIR Rust libraries (`fhirbolt`, `fhir-rs`) before creating custom structures
- [x] Define Rust structures for FHIRPath types (including collections)
- [x] Consider a "thin wrapper" view over `serde_json::Value` to avoid O(n) cloning
- [x] Implement FHIR resource representation compatible with FHIRPath
- [x] Create serialization/deserialization for JSON FHIR resources

**Status**: Completed

### 4. Expression evaluator implementation
- [x] Build the evaluator to operate on an iterator stack (lazy evaluation)
- [x] Implement AST visitor/evaluator with hooks for debug tracing (`#[cfg(feature = "trace")]`)
- [x] Implement all FHIRPath functions and operators
- [x] Add type checking and type conversion
- [x] Handle collections and collection operators
- [x] Add benchmarks with `criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["html_reports"] }`

**Status**: Completed

## Overall Phase Status
- **Completion**: 100%
- **Started Date**: 2025-07-17
- **Completed Date**: 2025-07-17
- **Notes**: Phase 2 implementation is complete with all core functionality working.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 3: Advanced Features
