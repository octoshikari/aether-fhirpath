## Implementation Summary

### Completed Infrastructure
1. **npm Packaging**: Both Node.js and WASM packages are properly configured with scoped names (@aether/fhirpath-node, @aether/fhirpath-wasm)
2. **Cross-Platform Builds**: Automated builds for all major platforms using NAPI-RS and GitHub Actions
3. **crates.io Publishing**: Workspace configuration ready for publishing Rust crates
4. **Release Automation**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, building, and publishing
