# Phase 4: Node.js Integration - Status

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating Node.js bindings for the FHIRPath engine, making it accessible from JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

## Tasks

### 1. Create Node.js binding layer
- [ ] Expose core FHIRPath functionality to JavaScript
- [ ] Handle data conversion between Rust and JavaScript
- [ ] Implement error handling and propagation
- [ ] Use `napi-rs`'s `#[napi(task)]` attribute for CPU-bound operations to offload to a thread pool

**Status**: Not started

### 2. Create TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Generate TypeScript interfaces for the library
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for better developer experience
- [ ] Support TypeScript's strict mode

**Status**: Not started

### 3. Create JavaScript-friendly API
- [ ] Design an idiomatic JavaScript API
- [ ] Implement Promise-based async interfaces where appropriate
- [ ] Add JavaScript-specific convenience functions
- [ ] Produce both CommonJS and ESModule entry points for maximum compatibility

**Status**: Not started

## Overall Phase Status
- **Completion**: 0%
- **Started Date**: Not started
- **Completed Date**: Not completed
- **Notes**: Phase 4 implementation has not begun yet.

## Next Steps
- Complete Phase 3 first
- Begin with basic Node.js binding layer
- Develop TypeScript type definitions in parallel with API design
