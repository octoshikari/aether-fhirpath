# Phase 4: Node.js Integration - Status

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating Node.js bindings for the FHIRPath engine, making it accessible from JavaScript/TypeScript applications.

## Tasks

### 1. Create Node.js binding layer
- [x] Expose core FHIRPath functionality to JavaScript
- [x] Handle data conversion between Rust and JavaScript
- [x] Implement error handling and propagation
- [x] Use tokio for CPU-bound operations to offload to a thread pool (async evaluation)

**Status**: Completed

### 2. Create TypeScript type definitions
- [x] Generate TypeScript interfaces for the library
- [x] Add JSDoc comments for a better developer experience
- [x] Support TypeScript's strict mode

**Status**: Completed

### 3. Create JavaScript-friendly API
- [x] Design an idiomatic JavaScript API
- [x] Implement Promise-based async interfaces where appropriate
- [x] Add JavaScript-specific convenience functions
- [x] Produce both CommonJS and ESModule entry points for maximum compatibility

**Status**: Completed

## Overall Phase Status
